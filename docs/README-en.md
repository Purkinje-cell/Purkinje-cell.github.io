## Quick Start

1. Fork this REPO and rename to `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` is your github USERNAME.
1. Configure the google scholar citation crawler (Optional):
    1. Find your google scholar ID in the url of your google scholar page (e.g., `https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SCHOLAR_ID`), where `SCHOLAR_ID` is your google scholar ID.
    1. Set GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID variable to your google scholar ID in `Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret` of the REPO website with `name=GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID` and `value=SCHOLAR_ID`.
    1. Click the `Actions` tab of the REPO website and enable the workflows by clicking *"I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"*.
    1. **Verification**: After enabling, check the workflow run status in the `Actions` tab. If successful, the `gs_data.json` file will be generated in the `google-scholar-stats` branch.
    1. **Note**: This github action will generate google scholar citation stats data `gs_data.json` in `google-scholar-stats` branch of your REPO. When you update your main branch, this action will be triggered. This action will also be triggered at 08:00 UTC everyday.
    1. **Troubleshooting**: If the workflow fails, please check:
        - Whether the `GOOGLE_SCHOLAR_ID` secret is correctly set
        - Whether the Google Scholar ID is valid
        - View detailed error logs in the `Actions` tab

        ```html
        <span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span>
        ```
